# ETL Testing

## What is ETL Testing?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load. ETL Testing is a process of how data is loaded from the source system to the data warehouse. Data is extracted from an OLTP database, transformed to match the data warehouse schema and loaded into the data warehouse database. ETL testing is done to ensure that the data that has been loaded from a source to the destination after business transformation is accurate.

## Why ETL Testing?

ETL testing is done to ensure that the data that has been loaded from a source to the destination after business transformation is accurate. It also involves the verification of data at various middle stages that are being used between source and destination. ETL testing is done before data is moved into a production data warehouse system.

## ETL Testing Process

The ETL testing process is as follows:

1. Identify the data sources and requirements
2. Understand the business rules
3. Test the data extraction
4. Test the data transformation
5. Test the data load
6. Validate the data
7. Perform regression testing
8. Perform performance testing
9. Perform integration testing
10. Perform user acceptance testing
11. Sign off
12. Production validation
13. Maintenance
14. Retesting

## There are different types of ETL testing, such as:

### New data warehouse testing:

- This is done when a new data warehouse is built from scratch. It involves validating the data sources, data models, business logic, ETL processes and data quality.

### Production validation testing:

This is done when data is moved from the source systems to the production data warehouse. It involves comparing the source and target data, checking the data integrity and consistency, and verifying the performance and scalability of the ETL processes.

### Source to target testing:

This is done to check if the data values in the source and target systems match after the ETL transformation. It involves mapping the source and target fields, applying filters and joins, and performing data reconciliation.

### Application upgrade testing:

This is done when an existing data warehouse application is upgraded or migrated to a new platform. It involves testing the compatibility, functionality and performance of the new application and ensuring that the data is not corrupted or lost during the migration.

### Metadata testing: \

This is done to check the metadata of the data warehouse, such as data types, lengths, indexes, constraints, etc. It involves verifying the metadata definitions, mappings and documentation.

## ETL testing follows a systematic process that includes the following steps:

- Identify data sources and requirements: This involves gathering and analyzing the business and technical requirements of the data warehouse, such as the scope, objectives, data sources, data models, data quality standards, etc.
- Prepare test data: This involves creating or selecting the test data that will be used for the ETL testing. The test data should be representative, realistic and sufficient to cover all the test scenarios and cases.
- Implement dimensional modeling and business logic: This involves designing and developing the data warehouse schema and the ETL processes that will transform and load the data from the source systems to the data warehouse. The dimensional modeling technique uses facts and dimensions to organize the data in a star or snowflake schema. The business logic defines the rules and calculations that will be applied to the data during the ETL process.

- Build and populate data: This involves executing the ETL processes and loading the data into the data warehouse tables. The data should be verified for accuracy, completeness, consistency and quality.

- Build reports: This involves creating and running the reports and dashboards that will provide the business insights and analytics from the data warehouse. The reports should be validated for correctness, readability and usability.

- ETL testing requires various tools and techniques to perform the different types of testing and to automate the testing process. Some of the common tools and techniques are:

### SQL queries:

SQL queries are used to perform data validation, data comparison, data aggregation, data manipulation and data extraction. SQL queries can be written in various dialects, such as Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, etc.

### ETL tools:

ETL tools are used to design, develop and execute the ETL processes. ETL tools can be classified into two categories: graphical user interface (GUI) based tools and code based tools. Some of the popular ETL tools are Informatica, Talend, SSIS, Pentaho, etc.

### Data quality tools:

Data quality tools are used to check and improve the quality of the data in the data warehouse. Data quality tools can perform various functions, such as data profiling, data cleansing, data standardization, data enrichment, data matching, data deduplication, etc. Some of the popular data quality tools are DataFlux, Trillium, Informatica Data Quality, etc.

### Testing tools:

Testing tools are used to automate and simplify the ETL testing process. Testing tools can perform various tasks, such as test planning, test case generation, test execution, test reporting, test management, etc. Some of the popular testing tools are Informatica Data Validation Option, QuerySurge, ICEDQ, etc.

### ETL testing faces various challenges and issues, such as:

- Complexity and volume of data: The data warehouse deals with large and complex data sets that come from various sources and formats. This makes the ETL testing process more difficult and time-consuming.
- Lack of documentation and standards: The data warehouse projects often lack proper documentation and standards for the data sources, data models, ETL processes, data quality, etc. This leads to confusion, inconsistency and errors in the ETL testing process.
- Dependency and coordination: The ETL testing process depends on various factors, such as the availability of the data sources, the readiness of the ETL processes, the access to the data warehouse, the alignment with the business requirements, etc. This requires a high level of coordination and communication among the different stakeholders, such as the business analysts, developers, testers, database administrators, etc.
- Performance and scalability: The ETL testing process should ensure that the data warehouse can handle the expected volume and velocity of data and provide the required performance and scalability. This requires testing the ETL processes for their efficiency, throughput, latency, concurrency, etc.
- ETL testing has a vital role in data governance, which is the process of managing and ensuring the quality, security, availability and usability of the data in the data warehouse. ETL testing helps in achieving the data governance objectives, such as:

### Data quality:
